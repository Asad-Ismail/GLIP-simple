# GLIP-Simple
A streamlined, from-scratch implementation of [GLIP (Official Repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP) focusing on core functionality and readability.

## ü§î Why This Repo?

While the official GLIP implementation is powerful and feature-rich, its complexity can make it challenging to:
- Understand the core architecture
- Implement the key concepts

This repository provides:
- Clean, modular implementation of GLIP's core components
- Simplified codebase without extra configurations
- Direct logit-based visualization and inference
- Easy-to-use dataloader for open-vocabulary detection

## Original vs Simplified

Nor

```diff
- 500+ lines of complex configuration-driven code
+ 150 lines of clean, focused implementation
```


| Feature | Original | Simplified |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Config Dependencies | Complex CFG system | Simple parameters |
| Code Size* (only core model) | 500+ lines | ~150 lines |
| Setup Complexity | High | Low |
| Core Functionality | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| V+L Fusion | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Token Projection | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Extra Features* | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
